<h4>An R package to deconvolute bulk RNA-Seq from scRNA-Seq data based on Deep Learning</h4></span>
</div>

<br>

The **digitalDLSorteR** R package provides a set of tools to deconvolute and infer cell type proportions of bulk RNA-Seq data through the development of context-specific deconvolution models based on Deep Learning and single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. These models are able to accurately enumerate and quantify cell proportions of bulk RNA-Seq data from specific biological environments. For more details about the algorithm and the functionalities implemented in this package, see [Torroja and Sanchez-Cabo, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00978/full), <https://diegommcc.github.io/digitalDLSorteR/>, and `vignette(digitalDLSorteR)`.

## Installation

**digitalDLSorteR** can be installed from GitHub, but will soon be available on CRAN.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("diegommcc/digitalDLSorteR")
```

It depends on Tensorflow R package, so a working Python interpreter with the Tensorflow Python library installed is needed. See <https://diegommcc.github.io/digitalDLSorteR/articles/kerasIssues.html> for more details.


## Rationale of **digitalDLSorteR**

This algorithm consists of training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with simulated bulk RNA-Seq samples whose cell composition is known. These 'pseudo-bulk RNA-Seq' samples are generated by aggregating pre-characterized scRNA-Seq data from specific biological environments. These models are able to accurately deconvolute new bulk RNA-Seq samples from the same environment since they are able to consider possible environmental-dependent transcriptional changes of specific cells, such as macrophages or other immune cells in complex diseases (e.g., specific subtypes of cancer or atherosclerosis). This aspect allows to overcome this limitation presents in other methods. For instance, in the case of immune cells, published methods usually rely on purified transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells despite the fact these cells are highly variable depending on the environment where they are. Therefore, considering this feature together with the use of powerful DNN models and the fact that improvement of scRNA-Seq datasets over time will allow to build better models, **digitalDLSorteR** offers a good alternative to classical methods based on linear models with pre-defined markers and irreal transcriptional references.

## Usage

The package has two main ways of usage:

1. Using pre-trained models included in `digitalLDSorteRmodels` package to deconvolute new bulk RNA-Seq samples from the same environment. So far, the available models allow to deconvolute samples from human breast cancer ([GSE75688](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75688) from [Chung et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15081) used as reference), and colorectal cancer ([GSE81861](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81861) from [Li et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3818) used as reference). For more details about this workflow, please see `vignette(digitalDLSorteR)` or . Moreover, in the panel A of the figure below it is summarized.
2. Building new deconvolution models from pre-characterized scRNA-Seq datasets. This workflow involves some requirements regarding computational resources, although **digitalDLSorteR** has been developed to provide with all the possible facilities to make the process easier, such as batch processing of data and the use of the `HDF5Array` and `DelayedArray` packages. For more information about this workflow, see `vignette(digitalDLSorteR)` at <https://diegommcc.github.io/digitalDLSorteR/>. Moreover, the main steps are summarized in the panel B of the figure below.

To use pre-trained context specific deconvolution models, **digitalDLSorteR** depends on **digitalDLSorteRmodels** data package as it makes available them. Therefore, it must be installed together with **digitalDLSorteR** if this functionality want to be used. To do so, the following code should be enough to install it from GitHub once **digitalDLSorteR** has been installed:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("digitalDLSorteRmodels", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("digitalDLSorteRmodels")
}
```

Also, it can be installed using devtools as follows:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("digitalDLSorteRmodels", quietly = TRUE)) {
  devtools::install_github("diegommcc/digitalDLSorteRmodels")
}
```

Once **digitalDLSorteRmodels** is loaded, the pre-trained models are available. See <https://diegommcc.github.io/digitalDLSorteR/articles/pretrainedModels.html> for some examples.

In addition, some examples and the vignettes of **digitalDLSorteR** make use of pre-computed datasets from the **digitalDLSorteRdata** package. If you want to inspect these pre-computed _DigitalDLSorter_ objects, you can install the package from GitHub using devtools as follows. See <https://diegommcc.github.io/digitalDLSorteR/articles/realModelExample.html> for an example.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("digitalDLSorteRdata", quietly = TRUE)) {
  devtools::install_github("diegommcc/digitalDLSorteRdata")
}
```
