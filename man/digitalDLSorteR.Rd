\title{digitalDLSorteR: an R package to deconvolute bulk RNA-Seq samples using
single-cell RNA-seq data and neural networks}
\description{
\pkg{digitalDLSorteR} is an R package that allows to deconvolute bulk RNA-seq
data using context-specific deconvolution models based on single-cell RNA-seq
data and neural Networks. These models are able to make accurate
estimates of cell composition of bulk RNA-Seq samples from the same
context using the meaningful information provided by scRNA-seq data.
See Torroja and Sanchez-Cabo (2019) (\doi{10.3389/fgene.2019.00978}) and
Ma√±anes et al., (2024) (\doi{10.1093/bioinformatics/btae072}) for more
details.

\details{
The method consists of a workflow that starts from
single-cell RNA-seq data and, after a few steps, a neural network model is
trained with simulated pseudo-bulk RNA-seq samples whose cell
composition is known. These trained models are able to deconvolute new bulk
RNA-seq samples from the same biological context. Its main advantage is the
possibility to build deconvolution models trained with real data from certain
biological environments. This fact tries to overcome the limitation
of other methods, since cell types may significantly change
their transcriptional profiles depending on tissue and disease context.

The package offers two usage ways: deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq samples
using pre-trained models available on the digitalDLSorteRmodels R package, or
building new deconvolution models from already identified scRNA-seq data.
